GitHub is a platform for hosting code that allows for version control and collaboration. It allows you and others to collaborate on projects from anywhere.

GitHub has become one of the few necessary platforms to use in today's web development world. It is a great tool that makes your life easier, has the potential to make you stand out from other web developers and hosts some of the biggest and most interesting projects out there today.

Different people and teams use GitHub for different projects. While we got our start as a version control platform, GitHub is now used to manage teams, share resumes, find new projects, track work, and host discussions, just to name a few.

GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles:

Version control - helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. 
Git - is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.

According to a Stack Overflow developer survey, over 87% of developers use Git.
